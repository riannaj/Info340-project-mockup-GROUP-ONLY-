        <h2>Problem + Data Domain</h2>
        <p> In today’s society, people are often driven by “hustle culture.” College students particularly have to balance their education, work, socializing, and planning their future - often meaning they unintentionally sacrifice their own health and well being. While this population is known for being technologically savvy, there is a lack of online resources to help support their own mental and physical well-being. Apps such as Finch have attempted to provide solutions to this issue by allowing users to track their habits through incentivised measures. However, Finch lacks an efficient streak feature, and has limited specifications for habit inputs. These points make it less efficient, meaning there is still a gap in this solution that should be addressed. </p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Who are the users of the application?</h3>
        <p>This app is designed for anyone who wants to build consistency with habits like exercising, getting enough sleep, or studying. It combines gentle support and gamification to make progress feel rewarding, rather than stressful. Users earn points for each completed habit and can connect with friends for extra motivation. The focus is on encouragement, not competition, and helping people stay on track in a positive and supportive way.</p>
        <h3>What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide?</h3>
        <p>Users will use the app to set personal goals, track daily habits, and celebrate their progress over time. The app will include three main interactive features: (1) a <strong>habit tracker</strong> that lets users create, edit, and check off their daily goals while viewing streaks and progress bars; (2) a <strong>points and rewards system</strong> that gamifies progress by giving users points for completed habits, which can unlock badges or milestones; and (3) a <strong>community feature</strong> that allows users to connect with friends or peers for encouragement and accountability. Together, these features make the app interactive, motivating, and socially engaging, providing both individual growth and shared motivation.</p>
        <h3>What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
        <p>Users will primarily view their personal progress data, such as completed habits, streaks, total points earned, and visual graphs showing consistency over time. They’ll also be able to view activity summaries or encouragement messages from friends, depending on their privacy settings. Most of the data will come directly from user input within the app rather than external sources. However, in future updates, the app could incorporate external wellness data, such as activity levels or sleep information from public datasets like the CDC’s Health Data API <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/">CDC Data Portal</a>, to provide more personalized insights and recommendations.</p>
        <h3>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h3>
        <p>This app helps solve the problem of inconsistent habits and lack of motivation by turning goal-setting into a positive, rewarding, and community-driven experience. Many people struggle to stay consistent because traditional productivity tools can feel rigid or discouraging when progress slows down.<strong> By offering rewards, visual progress, and supportive social features, this app keeps users motivated in a kind, non-competitive way.</strong>  It promotes mental well-being and self-discipline, encouraging users to make lasting changes in their routines. It also provides a sense of belonging and empowerment, reminding them that personal growth should feel supportive, not stressful.
